# Ash Calculator V1.0

This calculator was built using HTML, SCSS, JAVASCRIPT

# Operations

- Addition 
- Subtraction
- Division 
- Multiplication

# Current functionality

Currently 04/04/2022 This calculator can only handle one number and one operator at a time due to the way the array currently handles the split. The calculator is responsive on all devices and uses the grid function in CSS.

## Examples 
- 5*7=35 
- 9-3=6
- 4+9=13
- 6/2=3

# Improvements to be made

Improvements I shall make next would include:
- implement more than one digit functionality.
- Improve upon scss, add colours, change the shape of buttons, make the display and text different fonts and larger.
- Decimal points to be added and caluate accordingly.
